My project "RushHour" is a Smart Canteen Queue and Order Management System designed to reduce rush during peak hours.
Currently, students have to stand in long queues without knowing how long it will take.
My system allows users to view the menu, place orders online, and receive a token number with real-time status updates.
This helps reduce overcrowding and allows the canteen staff to manage orders more efficiently.
